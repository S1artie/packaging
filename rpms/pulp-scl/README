Package %{scl_name} provides dependencies for the Pulp application,
shipped as a Software Collection. For more information about Software
Collections, see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name}
collection, you will get the minimum working set of packages to install
Pulp.  This collection is not supported for other purposes.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'python'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

Pulp is a software repository managnement tool

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.
